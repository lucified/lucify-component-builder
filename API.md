### Options for single-page projects

- `title`: Page title
- `description`: Description metadata for social sharing, etc,
- `ogType`: Open graph type
- `twitterImage`: Filename for twitter card image
- `openGraphImage`: Filename for open graph (Facebook) image
- `schemaImage`: 'Filename for schema image

### Options for multi-page React-router projects

`pageDefs`: list of objects containing page metadata for all entry points. For each object, the same attributes as allowed for `pageDef` are recognized. They are optional. However, a `path` attribute is mandatory. It is the page's web path below `assetContext`.

### Options for projects with multiple embeds

`embedDefs`: object containing definitions of all embeds build within project. Recognizes the same attributes that are allowed for `pageDef`. They are optional. The following additional attributes are mandatory:
- `path`: The embeds' web path below `assetContext`
- `componentPath`: File system path to the React component bootstrapping the embed (`.jsx`).

### Deprecated options

`publishFromFolder`: Don't know whether this still works. Is currently defined as `dist` in all projects.

## `LUCIFY_ENV`

Most options have defaults. Some of them depend on `LUCIFY_ENV`. See `src/js/deploy-options.js` for details.

## Environment variables for notifications

If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is defined, will notify of new deployment with GitHub Deployment API.

If `FLOW_TOKEN` is defined, will use it to notify of successfull deployment to Flowdock.

## Environment variables for AWS

The build should have a set of AWS environment variables and/or credentials specified, suitable for deploying to `bucket`.

They can be defined in multiple ways

(1) `AWS_PROFILE` and `~/.aws/credentials`

(2) `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

(3) Optionally, you can define `OVERRIDE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `OVERRIDE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

(4) Also, `ENCRYPTED_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` is available. When this is used, `LUCIFY_ENC_PASS` should be defined, so that it can be decrypted.

## Possible future changes:

- Make `reactRouter` option more general, by allowing to use any custom boostrapping coder. This will allow usage of `lucify-component-builder` without React
